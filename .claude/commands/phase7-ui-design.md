Adopt the persona defined in `personas/ui-designer.md`. Read it now before proceeding.

Read these context files before proceeding:
- BRD: `docs/brd.md`
- Architecture: `docs/architecture.md` — route map for data shape awareness

Generate the following:
- Page inventory (all screens needed)
- Wireframe descriptions or mockups for each page
- User flow diagrams (mermaid syntax)
- Component inventory (reusable UI components)
- Responsive breakpoint strategy
- State designs for each page: loading, empty, error, populated

Save the output to `docs/ui-design.md`.

📋 REVIEW GATE: Does every BRD requirement have a corresponding screen? Are the user flows complete? Are error/empty states accounted for?
